ImagesInHell
============

This is the collection of screenshots and mockups used by my blog, [Users in Hell](http://usersinhell.com) ([phillco/usersinhell](https://github.com/phillco/usersinhell) on GitHub). The contents are always duplicated on [images.usersinhell.com](http://images.usersinhell.com).

Screenshots are an important part of any UI design blog, and I'd thought I'd create a nice, organized library for easy reference. Screenshots are grouped in folders by application/website; same with mockups.

Feel free to use these screenshots on your own blog, or [contribute new ones](https://github.com/phillco/imagesinhell/fork_select).
